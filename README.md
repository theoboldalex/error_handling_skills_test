 # 2025 Pegasus Skills Benchmark

Welcome back to Kata club! I am sure you have all been waiting for this next installment in the series of 
skills benchmarks :)

This repo is a collection of exercises focussed on error handling and writing performant, robust code.

As always, take your time. Ask for help if you need it. I am not looking for the first to finish, I am looking
for the most robust solution.

## Todo
